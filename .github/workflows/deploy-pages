# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs

## ⚙️ Essential Prerequisites

Before this workflow will work correctly, you must ensure two things are set up in your repository:

### 1. **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js` / `vite.config.ts`)**
If your GitHub Pages URL will be a subpath (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`), you must set the **base** path in your Vite config:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// Replace <repo-name> with your actual repository name
const repoName = 'your-repository-name'; 

// [https://vitejs.dev/config/](https://vitejs.dev/config/)
export default defineConfig({
  // Set the base path for GitHub Pages deployment
  base: `/${repoName}/`, 
  plugins: [react()],
})
